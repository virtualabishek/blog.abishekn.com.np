            <description><![CDATA[A reflection on the balance between thinking and truly living.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I stumbled across a post on X that really hit me:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/28bsnyYSZK">pic.twitter.com/28bsnyYSZK</a></p><p>— ★ (@thematrixwizard)<!-- --> </p><a href="https://twitter.com/thematrixwizard/status/1898988630967800312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"><p>March 10, 2025</p></a></blockquote>
<!-- -->
<p>The caption was simple: <strong>"Too much philosophy, not enough presence."</strong> And honestly, it felt so true. We spend so much of our lives chasing positivity—trying to do good, be good, and hope only the best comes our way. But life doesn’t always play along, does it?</p>
<p>A while back, I wrote something that ties into this. It went like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"These days, the internet is overflowing with inspirational quotes, movies, and posts. But what really matters is how much you actually live them, not just how much you scroll through or watch. Nothing lasts forever—not your beliefs, your motivations, or even your favorite sayings. Maybe they stick with you when you’re feeling on top of the world. But when you’re down, lost, or upset, I bet you forget all about that spark."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read more of my ramblings here: <a href="https://abishekn.com.np/perspective" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abishekn.com.np/perspective</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: all this hustling we do—working hard for a nice house, a fancy car, or to get better at something—it’s really about <strong>presence</strong>. People always say, <em>“Don’t dwell on the past, it’ll hurt you.”</em> Fair enough. But I’d argue looking too far into the future can mess up your <strong>now</strong> just as much. Every second you spend distracted or lost? It’s gone forever. You don’t get it back.</p>
<p>So, what I’m getting at is this: <strong>focus on the moment</strong>. Enjoy the process. I’m convinced that’s where real joy and happiness hide. Think about it—you forget where you left your keys, you miss an important moment because you’re zoned out, or you finally get something you’ve always wanted and feel that rush of pride. But do you remember how hard you worked for it? Probably not. Success has a way of wiping the slate clean. Then, boom, new desires pop up, and the cycle starts again.</p>
<p>That’s life, right? An endless loop of wanting, chasing, and forgetting. We all know this deep down—it’s nothing groundbreaking. But living it? Actually <strong>staying present</strong>? That’s the tricky part.</p>
<p>I’ll be real with you—I’m not even sure where I’m going with this. It’s just a stream of thoughts, typed out for fun. Hope you enjoyed it, though! Thanks for reading, and catch you in the next one.</p>]]></content:encoded>
