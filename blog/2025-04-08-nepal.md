Hey everyone, I just want to share some random thoughts today. Here in Nepal, people who aren’t interested in politicians, parties, or all that drama seem to suffer the most. I’ve had so many experiences—some made me feel terrible, others were good. Everything that’s happened to me, I always thought it’d leave a positive mark, teaching me lessons along the way.

There’s a lot swirling in my head right now. Honestly, people who went abroad right after +2 wouldn’t get what I’m talking about. I think those who left after their bachelor’s might understand more—they’ve probably seen more than I have.

I see quarrels everywhere here. Me, I’ve never been the type to fight or argue. Even when I’m not wrong, I end up saying sorry just to keep the peace. Sometimes, being too polite or asking simple questions makes you feel bad. Take today, for example—I was in Kathmandu for WordCamp 2025. I stopped at a local cafe and ordered a cup of tea. I didn’t have small change, so I handed the guy a 500-rupee note. He said he didn’t have change, which was fine—I get it, maybe I was the first customer of the day. So I asked if there was a QR code to pay digitally. He said no, and I was shocked. I went to a nearby shop, bought something I didn’t even need just to break the 500, and came back to pay. Then he goes, “Why should I get a QR code for this? If it was something like rice or a big meal, I’d understand.” Bro, who comes to your shop at 6 a.m. to eat a heavy meal? So yeah, that’s just one little thing from today.

I’ve been through a lot and forgotten even more. Public transport here? Don’t get me started. I’ve had so many bad experiences. Whenever I travel to Kathmandu, back to Chitwan, or anywhere else, it’s always a mess. I ask for a specific seat when I buy my ticket, and they tell me it’s full, shoving me to the back. Later, I find out it wasn’t full—they just wanted to pack the back seats first. The fares? I’ve been cheated so many times. They charge whatever they feel like. Once, they owed me 300 rupees in change—it was even written on the ticket—but they argued with me and refused to pay. During festivals, not even on the main day of Dashain, but toward the end, they double the fare. Where do I complain? How do I fix this? I just end up letting it go.

And education? It’s a disaster. I study at Tribhuvan University (TU), Institute of Science and Technology. I’ve switched between two government colleges. I’m not into politics or parties—you probably know how things work there if you’re not involved. The education system is a total waste, at least from my perspective. TU and its government colleges feel like a cheap certificate factory. You’re on your own—your browser tabs are your real teachers. I’m not blaming the teachers; it’s the system. Getting anything done takes forever—long processes for even the smallest service.

I’m exhausted, honestly. Still, I’m hoping for the best.
