# Village Realities: A Four-Day Revelation

Okay, so here's the real talk: I always imagined villages as disciplined, polite, and honest places. But after a four-day tour to a rural area of Nepal, I've come to realize that villages can actually be more challenging than urban areas. It was quite a shock; everyone seemed to be comparing themselves to each other and constantly getting into conflicts. I stayed in more than six different houses, and almost every single one had some kind of underlying problem.

Let me share some profound truths I learned from an 82-year-old man:

> - **Manage your expectations and always act with good behavior.** (This is something I already knew, but it was a powerful reminder.)
> - **God always provides a way.** If you face a problem in one area, a solution will emerge in another. For instance, if someone lacks sight, their other senses become incredibly sharp.
> - **Steer clear of political parties.** They're often just trouble. Just vote for who you believe in.
> - **Choose your companions wisely.** Always surround yourself with good people, even if it means being alone sometimes.
> - **Never pursue love or marriage based solely on phone interactions.** It's often an illusion; the real world is entirely different.
> - **Your mother is paramount.** She carried you for nine months, enduring so much, and then showed you the world. Cherish her.
> - He also taught me a lot about **Karma**.

# Tech Wisdom from a Nonagenarian

Perhaps the most fascinating encounter was with an 85-year-old man who knew an incredible amount about computers â€“ almost as much as a computer science student! He shared insights into computer evolution and even knew **QBASIC**, a language that's practically ancient now. He explained different types of printers and emphasized that to truly understand technology, "you have to know everything about everything. You should know instructions and all."

He also gave me valuable advice on how to approach answers, especially in exams. He stressed the importance of incorporating **modern trends** to show the examiner you're well-read. For example, if you're writing about computer viruses, you should include examples of current virus names. He also touched upon versioning, explaining how different versions of software like Word or Excel (e.g., 2016) can complicate things. He gave a relatable example: we were taught what PowerPoint is and how it works, but we were rarely shown any practical demonstrations.

This led to his core message: **"Practical is the way. Just focus on practical rather than theory."** I completely agree with him on this. Thank you, Buwa, for these invaluable lessons.
