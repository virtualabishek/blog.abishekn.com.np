The tech stack was completely different from anything I\u2019d tackled before. I built a portal using PHP, with the entire UI crafted in HTML. Coming from a Node.js background, I was out of my comfort zone, unsure of what to do and what to avoid. I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t be that developer who sticks to just one tech stack\u2014especially in today\u2019s world, where AI makes it possible for anyone to create almost anything. Still, the process wasn\u2019t easy.

I handled routing with a switch statement, manually creating all the routes and APIs from scratch. Where I really struggled was the file structure.

But they saw the demo, liked it, and are ready to move forward. I was floored\u2014part of me was like, \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d What if I need to add more features?

But here\u2019s the bigger picture: coding, at its core, is about breaking problems into smaller, manageable steps. With AI and modern tools, that\u2019s more true than ever. If you can take one big problem and split it into ten smaller ones\u2014and truly understand what your code is doing\u2014you can build anything. The tools or tech stack? They\u2019re secondary. What matters is understanding the ecosystem and how it all fits together."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I\u2019ve been crazy busy lately, juggling board exam prep and multiple projects, but I\u2019m enjoying the process.
