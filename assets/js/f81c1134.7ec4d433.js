[Understanding Basic Locking and MVCC](#understanding-basic-locking-and-mvcc)\\n\\n## Working with PostgreSQL Transactions\\n\\nIn PostgreSQL, every operation is part of a transaction, even single statements. Transactions ensure data consistency and integrity.\\n\\n### Key Functions for Timestamps\\n\\n- **`now()`**: Returns the same timestamp for all statements within a transaction, ensuring consistency.\\n\\n  - Example: Useful for logging actions with a consistent timestamp.\\n  - ```sql\\n    SELECT now(), now();\\n    ```\\n    Output:\\n    ```\\n               now                |               now\\n    ----------------------------------+----------------------------------\\n     2025-08-14 13:05:37.943104+05:45 | 2025-08-14 13:05:37.943104+05:45\\n    (1 row)\\n    ```\\n    - Both calls to `now()` return the same timestamp within a single transaction.\\n\\n- **`clock_timestamp()`**: Returns the real-time timestamp for each call, even within the same transaction.\\n  - Example: Useful for measuring query execution time.\\n  - ```sql\\n    SELECT clock_timestamp();\\n    ```\\n    Output:\\n    ```\\n             clock_timestamp\\n    ----------------------------------\\n     2025-08-14 13:06:42.247353+05:45\\n    (1 row)\\n    ```\\n\\n### Explicit Transactions\\n\\nTo group multiple statements into a single transaction, use the `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` commands:\\n\\n- **`BEGIN`**: Starts a transaction.\\n- **`COMMIT` or `END`**: Commits the transaction, making changes permanent.\\n- **`ROLLBACK` or `ABORT`**: Discards changes made in the transaction.\\n- Example:\\n\\n  ```sql\\n  BEGIN;\\n  SELECT now();\\n  SELECT now();\\n  COMMIT;\\n  ```\\n\\n  Output:\\n\\n  ```\\n  BEGIN\\n               now\\n  ----------------------------------\\n   2025-08-14 13:11:50.579118+05:45\\n  (1 row)\\n\\n               now\\n  ----------------------------------\\n   2025-08-14 13:11:50.579118+05:45\\n  (1 row)\\n\\n  COMMIT\\n  ```\\n\\n  - Both `now()` calls return the same timestamp, as they are part of the same transaction.\\n\\n### Read-Only Transactions\\n\\nSet a transaction to read-only to prevent modifications:\\n\\n- ```sql\\n  SHOW transaction_read_only;\\n  BEGIN TRANSACTION READ ONLY;\\n  SELECT 1;\\n  COMMIT AND CHAIN;\\n  SHOW transaction_read_only;\\n  COMMIT;\\n  ```\\n\\n  Output:\\n\\n  ```\\n   transaction_read_only\\n  -----------------------\\n   off\\n  (1 row)\\n\\n  BEGIN\\n   ?column?\\n  ----------\\n          1\\n  (1 row)\\n\\n  COMMIT\\n   transaction_read_only\\n  -----------------------\\n   on\\n  (1 row)\\n\\n  COMMIT\\n  ```\\n\\n  - Initially, `transaction_read_only` is `off` (read/write mode).\\n  - `BEGIN TRANSACTION READ ONLY` sets it to `on`.\\n  - `COMMIT AND CHAIN` commits the transaction and starts a new one with the same read-only property.\\n\\nTo get help for commands in `psql`:\\n\\n- ```sql\\n  \\\\h COMMIT;\\n  ```\\n\\n  Output:\\n\\n  ```\\n  Command:     COMMIT\\n  Description: commit the current transaction\\n  Syntax:\\n  COMMIT [ WORK | TRANSACTION ] [ AND [ NO ] CHAIN ]\\n  URL: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-commit.html\\n  ```\\n\\n- ```sql\\n  \\\\h ROLLBACK;\\n  ```\\n  Output:\\n  ```\\n  Command:     ROLLBACK\\n  Description: abort the current transaction\\n  Syntax:\\n  ROLLBACK [ WORK | TRANSACTION ] [ AND [ NO ] CHAIN ]\\n  URL: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-rollback.html\\n  ```\\n\\n## Handling Errors Inside a Transaction\\n\\nIf an error occurs within a transaction, PostgreSQL aborts the transaction, and subsequent commands are ignored until the transaction is rolled back or committed.\\n\\n- Example:\\n\\n  ```sql\\n  BEGIN;\\n  SELECT 1;\\n  SELECT 1/0;\\n  SELECT 2;\\n  COMMIT;\\n  ```\\n\\n  Output:\\n\\n  ```\\n  BEGIN\\n   ?column?\\n  ----------\\n          1\\n  (1 row)\\n\\n  ERROR:  division by zero\\n  ERROR:  current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block\\n  ROLLBACK\\n  ```\\n\\n  - The `division by zero` error aborts the transaction.\\n  - The subsequent `SELECT 2` is ignored until `ROLLBACK` resets the transaction state.\\n  - Use `ROLLBACK` to discard changes and recover from the error.\\n\\n## Using SAVEPOINT\\n\\nSavepoints allow partial rollbacks within a transaction, enabling recovery from errors without discarding all changes.\\n\\n- Example:\\n\\n  ```sql\\n  BEGIN;\\n  SELECT 1;\\n  SAVEPOINT a;\\n  SELECT 2/0;\\n  ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT a;\\n  SELECT 2;\\n  SELECT 3;\\n  COMMIT;\\n  ```\\n\\n  Output:\\n\\n  ```\\n  BEGIN\\n   ?column?\\n  ----------\\n          1\\n  (1 row)\\n\\n  SAVEPOINT\\n  ERROR:  division by zero\\n  ERROR:  current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block\\n  ROLLBACK\\n   ?column?\\n  ----------\\n          2\\n  (1 row)\\n\\n   ?column?\\n  ----------\\n          3\\n  (1 row)\\n\\n  COMMIT\\n  ```\\n\\n  - `SAVEPOINT a` marks a point in the transaction.\\n  - After the `division by zero` error, `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT a` reverts to the state at `a`.\\n  - Subsequent commands (`SELECT 2`, `SELECT 3`) execute successfully.\\n  - Use `RELEASE SAVEPOINT <name>` to remove a savepoint if no longer needed.\\n\\n## Transactional DDLs\\n\\nPostgreSQL supports transactional Data Definition Language (DDL) operations, meaning DDL commands (e.g., `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`) can be rolled back if the transaction fails.\\n\\n- Example:\\n\\n  ```sql\\n  BEGIN;\\n  CREATE TABLE testme (id int);\\n  ALTER TABLE testme ALTER COLUMN id TYPE int8;\\n  CREATE TABLE testme2 (name VARCHAR(20));\\n  ALTER TABLE testme2 ALTER COLUMN name TYPE VARCHAR(50);\\n  \\\\d testme;\\n  \\\\d testme2;\\n  ROLLBACK;\\n  \\\\d testme;\\n  ```\\n\\n  Output:\\n\\n  ```\\n  BEGIN\\n  CREATE TABLE\\n  ALTER TABLE\\n  CREATE TABLE\\n  ALTER TABLE\\n                Table \\"public.testme\\"\\n   Column |  Type  | Collation | Nullable | Default\\n  --------+--------+-----------+----------+---------\\n   id     | bigint |           |          |\\n\\n                     Table \\"public.testme2\\"\\n   Column |         Type          | Collation | Nullable | Default\\n  --------+-----------------------+-----------+----------+---------\\n   name   | character varying(50) |           |          |\\n\\n  ROLLBACK\\n  Did not find any relation named \\"testme\\".\\n  ```\\n\\n  - The tables `testme` and `testme2` are created and modified within the transaction.\\n  - After `ROLLBACK`, both tables are removed, as the transaction was not committed.\\n  - The final `\\\\d testme;` confirms the table no longer exists.\\n\\n## Understanding Basic Locking and MVCC\\n\\nPostgreSQL uses **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)** to handle concurrent transactions, ensuring that read operations do not block write operations and vice versa.\\n\\n### Example: Concurrent Read and Write\\n\\n- **Transaction 1**:\\n\\n  ```sql\\n  BEGIN;\\n  SELECT * FROM testme;\\n  UPDATE testme SET id = id + 1 RETURNING *;\\n  COMMIT;\\n  ```\\n\\n  Output:\\n\\n  ```\\n  BEGIN\\n   id\\n  ----\\n    0\\n  (1 row)\\n\\n   id\\n  ----\\n    1\\n  (1 row)\\n\\n  UPDATE 1\\n  COMMIT\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Transaction 2** (concurrent):\\n\\n  ```sql\\n  BEGIN;\\n  SELECT * FROM testme;\\n  COMMIT;\\n  ```\\n\\n  Output:\\n\\n  ```\\n  BEGIN\\n   id\\n  ----\\n    0\\n  (1 row)\\n\\n  COMMIT\\n  ```\\n\\n  - Transaction 2 sees the data as it was before Transaction 1\u2019s update (`id = 0`) due to MVCC.\\n  - Write transactions (e.g., `UPDATE`) do not block read transactions (e.g., `SELECT`).\\n\\n### Concurrent Updates\\n\\nWhen multiple transactions update the same table:\\n\\n- **Transaction 1**:\\n\\n  ```sql\\n  BEGIN;\\n  UPDATE testme SET id = id + 1 RETURNING *;\\n  UPDATE testme SET id = id + 1 RETURNING *;\\n  COMMIT;\\n  ```\\n\\n  Output:\\n\\n  ```\\n  BEGIN\\n   id\\n  ----\\n    2\\n  (1 row)\\n\\n  UPDATE 1\\n   id\\n  ----\\n    3\\n  (1 row)\\n\\n  UPDATE 1\\n  COMMIT\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Transaction 2** (after Transaction 1 commits):\\n\\n  ```sql\\n  BEGIN;\\n  UPDATE testme SET id = id + 1 RETURNING *;\\n  COMMIT;\\n  ```\\n\\n  Output:\\n\\n  ```\\n  BEGIN\\n   id\\n  ----\\n    4\\n  (1 row)\\n\\n  UPDATE 1\\n  COMMIT\\n  ```\\n\\n  - Transaction 2 updates the row after Transaction 1 commits, incrementing `id` to 4.\\n  - PostgreSQL locks only the rows affected by an `UPDATE`, allowing concurrent updates on different rows in the same table.\\n  - For example, with 1,000 rows, 1,000 concurrent updates can occur on different rows without conflict.\\n\\n### Additional Example\\n\\n- **Transaction**:\\n  ```sql\\n  BEGIN;\\n  SELECT * FROM testme;\\n  ```\\n  Output:\\n  ```\\n  BEGIN\\n   id\\n  ----\\n    1\\n  (1 row)\\n  ```\\n\\n## Additional Notes\\n\\n- Use `\\\\h <command>` in `psql` to get help for commands like `SELECT`, `COMMIT`, or `ROLLBACK`.\\n- PostgreSQL\u2019s MVCC ensures high concurrency by maintaining multiple versions of data, allowing readers to see a consistent snapshot without waiting for writers.\\n- Always commit or roll back transactions explicitly to avoid leaving connections in an aborted state.\\n- The note \\"aba jaba, transaction 1 commit vayo, ani transaction 2 update huncha\\" translates to \\"now then, transaction 1 is committed, and transaction 2 updates\\" in Nepali, indicating the sequence of commits and updates.\\n\\nFor more details, refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/index.html)."},{"id":"database-comparision","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/database-comparision","source":"@site/blog/2025-08-13-database-comparision.md","title":"Database Comparision between PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server","description":"I explored different database and compared with each other.

I\u2019ve compared popular databases and implemented an accounting system using PostgreSQL, including a Python script to generate and load 10,000 transaction records. This is tailored for contexts like ABC Warehouse, where I study, to estimate storage and performance needs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why This Project?\\n\\nIn Nepal, startups, colleges, and SMEs need cost-effective, scalable databases for applications like accounting systems. I\u2019ve compared PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server, and Oracle, and built a practical accounting system with storage estimates and performance tests. PostgreSQL is my top choice due to its power, flexibility, and zero licensing cost, perfect for Nepali use cases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Database Comparison\\n\\nHere\u2019s a friendly breakdown of the databases I considered, with pros, cons, and use cases for Nepali users:\\n\\n### PostgreSQL\\n\\n**\u201cThe modern, feature-rich open-source option \u2014 great for new, technically-savvy teams.\u201d**\\n\\n- **Pros**:\\n  - No licensing cost, ideal for startups and colleges.\\n  - Advanced SQL features (window functions, CTEs, partitioning).\\n  - JSONB for flexible schemas (SQL + NoSQL).\\n  - PostGIS for geospatial apps (e.g., nearest hospital or delivery routing).\\n  - Strong concurrency with MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) for heavy read/write apps.\\n  - Easy to deploy on VPS or managed services (AWS RDS, DigitalOcean, Aiven).\\n- **Cons**: Slightly steeper learning curve than MySQL for admin tasks; less common in some regulated industries (e.g., finance/healthcare).\\n- **Use When**: You want power without cost, especially for modern web apps, analytics, or geospatial projects.\\n\\n### MySQL (Community)\\n\\n**\u201cSimple, common, and cheap \u2014 great for small or legacy web apps.\u201d**\\n\\n- **Pros**: Easy to find cheap hosting; widely used in PHP-based apps (LAMP stack).\\n- **Cons**: Fewer advanced features compared to PostgreSQL or Oracle; often limited to simpler or legacy systems.\\n- **Use When**: You\u2019re on shared hosting or building simple PHP-based apps with minimal cost.\\n\\n### MS SQL Server\\n\\n**\u201cThe comfortable, enterprise choice for Windows/.NET shops.\u201d**\\n\\n- **Pros**: Easy to learn, great GUI tools (SSMS), automation-friendly, common in business settings.\\n- **Cons**: Expensive licensing for large deployments (Express edition is free for small projects); often tied to Windows Server costs.\\n- **Use When**: Your organization uses the Microsoft stack or needs fast onboarding for DBAs.\\n\\n### Oracle\\n\\n**\u201cThe power tool \u2014 huge feature set and top pay, but steep learning and cost.\u201d**\\n\\n- **Pros**: Extremely powerful for large, mission-critical systems; top-tier enterprise features.\\n- **Cons**: Expensive and complex licensing; steep learning curve; often requires dedicated DBAs.\\n- **Use When**: Large enterprises (banks, telecoms, ERP systems) with big budgets and existing Oracle setups.\\n\\n**Recommendation for Nepali Context**: I recommend **PostgreSQL** for most startups, colleges, and SMEs due to its power, flexibility, and no licensing cost.

The system tracks **transactions**, **students**, **invoices**, and **invoice line items**. Below is the schema and storage estimation.\\n\\n### Schema Overview\\n\\n#### Transactions Table\\n\\nStores journal entries for accounting (e.g., date, particulars, credit, debit).\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE transactions (\\n    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\\n    date DATE NOT NULL,\\n    particulars VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,\\n    credit NUMERIC(12,2) DEFAULT 0,\\n    debit NUMERIC(12,2) DEFAULT 0,\\n    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\\n    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\\n);\\n```\\n\\n#### Students Table\\n\\nStores student information for invoicing.\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE students (\\n    student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\\n    email TEXT,\\n    phone VARCHAR(15),\\n    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\\n    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\\n);\\n```\\n\\n#### Invoices Table\\n\\nTracks invoices issued to students.\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE invoices (\\n    invoice_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\\n    student_id INT REFERENCES students(student_id),\\n    issue_date DATE NOT NULL,\\n    due_date DATE NOT NULL,\\n    total_amount NUMERIC(12,2) NOT NULL,\\n    paid_amount NUMERIC(12,2) DEFAULT 0,\\n    balance_due NUMERIC(12,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (total_amount - paid_amount) STORED,\\n    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,\\n    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\\n    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\\n);\\n```\\n\\n#### Invoice Line Items Table\\n\\nDetails items in each invoice (e.g., tuition fees, lab fees).\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE invoice_line_items (\\n    line_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\\n    invoice_id INT REFERENCES invoices(invoice_id),\\n    item_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\\n    description TEXT,\\n    quantity INT NOT NULL,\\n    unit_price NUMERIC(12,2) NOT NULL,\\n    amount NUMERIC(12,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (quantity * unit_price) STORED,\\n    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\\n    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\\n);\\n```\\n\\n### Storage Estimation\\n\\nI estimated storage needs for the accounting system based on **10 transactions/day**, **10 students/day**, and **10 invoices/day** with **3 line items per invoice**. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\\n\\n#### Transactions Table\\n\\n- **Fields**: id (4 bytes), date (4 bytes), particulars (200 bytes), credit (8 bytes), debit (8 bytes), created_at (8 bytes), updated_at (8 bytes).\\n- **Total per row**: 236 bytes + 27 bytes (PostgreSQL overhead) \u2248 **263 bytes**.\\n- **Daily**: 10 transactions \xd7 263 bytes = **2.57 KB**.\\n- **Monthly**: 30 days \xd7 2.57 KB \u2248 **77.1 KB**.\\n- **Yearly**: 360 days \xd7 2.57 KB \u2248 **925 KB**.\\n\\n#### Students Table\\n\\n- **Fields**: student_id (4 bytes), name (100 bytes), email (50 bytes), phone (15 bytes), created_at (8 bytes), updated_at (8 bytes).\\n- **Total per row**: 185 bytes + 27 bytes (overhead) \u2248 **212 bytes**.\\n- **Daily**: 10 students \xd7 212 bytes \u2248 **2.07 KB**.\\n- **Monthly**: 30 days \xd7 2.07 KB \u2248 **62.1 KB**.\\n- **Yearly**: 360 days \xd7 2.07 KB \u2248 **746 KB**.\\n\\n#### Invoices Table\\n\\n- **Fields**: invoice_id (4 bytes), student_id (4 bytes), issue_date (4 bytes), due_date (4 bytes), total_amount (8 bytes), paid_amount (8 bytes), balance_due (8 bytes), status (20 bytes), created_at (8 bytes), updated_at (8 bytes).\\n- **Total per row**: 76 bytes + 23 bytes (overhead) \u2248 **99 bytes**.\\n- **Daily**: 10 invoices \xd7 99 bytes \u2248 **0.97 KB**.\\n- **Monthly**: 30 days \xd7 0.97 KB \u2248 **29.1 KB**.\\n- **Yearly**: 360 days \xd7 0.97 KB \u2248 **349 KB**.\\n\\n#### Invoice Line Items Table\\n\\n- **Fields**: line_id (4 bytes), invoice_id (4 bytes), item_name (50 bytes), description (200 bytes), quantity (4 bytes), unit_price (8 bytes), amount (8 bytes), created_at (8 bytes), updated_at (8 bytes).\\n- **Total per row**: 294 bytes + 27 bytes (overhead) \u2248 **321 bytes**.\\n- **Daily**: 10 invoices \xd7 3 line items \xd7 321 bytes \u2248 **9.4 KB**.\\n- **Monthly**: 30 days \xd7 9.4 KB \u2248 **282 KB**.\\n- **Yearly**: 360 days \xd7 9.4 KB \u2248 **3.38 MB**.\\n\\n#### Total Storage\\n\\n- **Daily**: 2.57 KB (transactions) + 2.07 KB (students) + 0.97 KB (invoices) + 9.4 KB (line items) \u2248 **12.44 KB/day**.\\n- **Monthly**: 12.44 KB \xd7 30 \u2248 **373 KB/month**.\\n- **Yearly**: 12.44 KB \xd7 360 \u2248 **4.48 MB/year**.\\n\\n### Scalability Notes\\n\\n- **PostgreSQL\u2019s MVCC**: Handles high concurrency without locking, ideal for heavy read/write workloads (e.g., frequent transactions at a college).\\n- **Storage Growth**: Even with 360 transactions/year, the database size remains small (~4.48 MB/year), easily manageable on a VPS or managed service.\\n- **Performance**: Importing 100,000 transactions took ~204 ms, showing PostgreSQL\u2019s efficiency for moderate workloads.\\n- **Balance Sheet Queries**: Use SQL aggregates (e.g., `SUM(credit)`, `SUM(debit)`) to generate balance sheets or trial balances.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Generating and Loading Data with Python\\n\\nTo test the system\u2019s performance, I wrote a Python script to generate 10,000 transaction records and load them into the `transactions` table. The script creates a tab-delimited CSV file (`transactions.txt`) and uses PostgreSQL\u2019s `\\\\copy` command to import the data efficiently.\\n\\n### Python Script for Data Generation\\n\\n```python\\nimport csv\\nimport random\\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\\n\\n# Generate 10,000 transaction records\\nnum_records = 10000\\nstart_date = datetime(2025, 1, 1)\\nparticulars_list = [\\"Tuition Fee\\", \\"Lab Fee\\", \\"Library Fee\\", \\"Exam Fee\\", \\"Miscellaneous\\"]\\n\\nwith open(\'/tmp/transactions.txt\', \'w\', newline=\'\') as f:\\n    writer = csv.writer(f, delimiter=\'\\\\t\')\\n    writer.writerow([\'date\', \'particulars\', \'credit\', \'debit\'])  # CSV header\\n    for i in range(num_records):\\n        date = (start_date + timedelta(days=random.randint(0, 365))).strftime(\'%Y-%m-%d\')\\n        particulars = random.choice(particulars_list)\\n        credit = round(random.uniform(0, 5000), 2) if random.random() > 0.5 else 0\\n        debit = round(random.uniform(0, 5000), 2) if credit == 0 else 0\\n        writer.writerow([date, particulars, credit, debit])\\n\\nprint(f\\"Generated {num_records} transaction records in /tmp/transactions.txt\\")\\n```\\n\\n### Loading Data into PostgreSQL\\n\\nI ran into some permission issues when trying to load the data initially (e.g., `Permission denied` for `/home/virtualabishek/Desktop/code/learning/postgres-notes/transactions.txt`). To fix this, I moved the file to `/tmp/` and used the `\\\\copy` command, which is client-side and avoids server permission issues:\\n\\n```sql\\n\\\\copy transactions(date, particulars, credit, debit) FROM \'/tmp/transactions.txt\' DELIMITER E\'\\\\t\' CSV HEADER;\\n```\\n\\nThis successfully loaded 100,000 records (I tested with a larger dataset to stress-test), taking ~204 ms, as shown in my terminal output:\\n\\n```\\nCOPY 100000\\nTime: 204.345 ms\\n```\\n\\n### Lessons Learned\\n\\n- **COPY vs. \\\\copy**: I initially tried `COPY`, but got a `Permission denied` error because it runs server-side. Switching to `\\\\copy` resolved this.\\n- **File Permissions**: Moving the file to `/tmp/` avoided permission issues, as `/tmp/` is accessible to the PostgreSQL client.\\n- **Performance**: Loading 100,000 records in ~204 ms shows PostgreSQL\u2019s efficiency for bulk imports.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why PostgreSQL for This Project?\\n\\nI chose PostgreSQL because:\\n\\n- **No License Cost**: Perfect for budget-conscious Nepali startups and colleges.\\n- **Rich Data Types**: Supports JSONB for flexible schemas, GEOMETRY for geospatial queries (e.g., campus mapping), and NUMERIC for precise accounting.\\n- **Concurrency**: MVCC ensures readers and writers don\u2019t block each other, ideal for busy systems.\\n- **Extensibility**: PostGIS for geospatial apps, full-text search, and more.\\n- **Deployment**: Easy to run on a VPS or use managed providers (AWS RDS, Aiven).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Setup Instructions\\n\\n1. **Install PostgreSQL**:\\n\\n   - On Ubuntu: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib`\\n   - Verify: `psql --version`\\n\\n2. **Create Database**:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo -u postgres createdb accountdb\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Set Up Tables**:\\n\\n   - Connect: `psql -d accountdb`\\n   - Run the `CREATE TABLE` statements above for `transactions`, `students`, `invoices`, and `invoice_line_items`.\\n\\n4. **Generate Data**:\\n\\n   - Run the Python script above to create `/tmp/transactions.txt` with 10,000 records.\\n\\n5. **Import Data**:\\n\\n   - Import:\\n     ```bash\\n     psql -d accountdb -c \\"\\\\copy transactions(date, particulars, credit, debit) FROM \'/tmp/transactions.txt\' DELIMITER E\'\\\\t\' CSV HEADER\\"\\n     ```\\n\\n6. **Check Database Size**:\\n\\n   ```sql\\n   SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database()));\\n   ```\\n\\n   My test showed ~18 MB for the database with 100,000 transaction records.\\n\\n7. **Monitor Performance**:\\n   - Enable timing: `\\\\timing on`\\n   - Run imports or queries to measure execution time (e.g., ~204 ms for 100,000 records).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Example Queries\\n\\n- **List Transactions**:\\n\\n  ```sql\\n  SELECT * FROM transactions LIMIT 10;\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Calculate Balance Sheet**:\\n\\n  ```sql\\n  SELECT SUM(credit) AS total_credit, SUM(debit) AS total_debit\\n  FROM transactions\\n  WHERE date BETWEEN \'2025-01-01\' AND \'2025-12-31\';\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Find Unpaid Invoices**:\\n  ```sql\\n  SELECT i.invoice_id, s.name, i.total_amount, i.balance_due\\n  FROM invoices i\\n  JOIN students s ON i.student_id = s.student_id\\n  WHERE i.status = \'UNPAID\';\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Future Improvements\\n\\n- Add indexes on frequently queried columns (e.g., `date`, `student_id`) for faster searches.\\n- Implement triggers to auto-update `updated_at` timestamps.\\n- Use JSONB for flexible transaction metadata (e.g., store tax info).\\n- Explore PostGIS for campus-related geospatial queries (e.g., mapping student locations).\\n- Optimize the Python script to generate larger datasets or simulate realistic transaction patterns.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Final Note\\n\\nI built this accounting system to be lightweight (4.48 MB/year for 10 transactions/day), scalable, and cost-effective using PostgreSQL. The Python script made it easy to generate and load 10,000 records, and PostgreSQL\u2019s performance (~204 ms for 100,000 records) proves it\u2019s ready for real-world use. Let\u2019s keep building awesome tech for Nepal!"},{"id":"tech-wisdom-from-a-85-year-old-buwa","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tech-wisdom-from-a-85-year-old-buwa","source":"@site/blog/2025-07-06-reflection-of-4-days-tour.md","title":"Tech Wisdom and Village realitie","description":"Tech Wisdom by 85 years old man and village realities","date":"2025-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Philosophy","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/philosophy","description":"You can find all Philosophy related blogs here."},{"inline":false,"label":"Technical","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/technical","description":"You can find all technical related blogs here."}],"readingTime":2.16,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Abishek Neupane","title":"Self Learner","url":"https://github.com/virtualabishek","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/virtualabishek"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/virtualabishek","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/virtualabishek/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/virtualabishek"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/virtualabishek.png","key":"virtualabishek"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"tech-wisdom-from-a-85-year-old-buwa","title":"Tech Wisdom and Village realitie","authors":["virtualabishek"],"date":"2025-07-06","description":"Tech Wisdom by 85 years old man and village realities","tags":["philosophy","technical"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Database Comparision between PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server","permalink":"/blog/database-comparision"},"nextItem":{"title":"From Chaos to Clarity","permalink":"/blog/breaking-down-the-problem"}},"content":"Okay, so here\'s the real talk: I always imagined villages as disciplined, polite, and honest places. But after a four-day tour to a rural area of Nepal, I\'ve come to realize that villages can actually be more challenging than urban areas. It was quite a shock; everyone seemed to be comparing themselves to each other and constantly getting into conflicts. I stayed in more than six different houses, and almost every single one had some kind of underlying problem.\\n\\nLet me share some profound truths I learned from an 82-year-old man:\\n\\n> - **Manage your expectations and always act with good behavior.** (This is something I already knew, but it was a powerful reminder.)\\n> - **God always provides a way.** If you face a problem in one area, a solution will emerge in another. For instance, if someone lacks sight, their other senses become incredibly sharp.\\n> - **Steer clear of political parties.** They\'re often just trouble. Just vote for who you believe in.\\n> - **Choose your companions wisely.** Always surround yourself with good people, even if it means being alone sometimes.\\n> - **Never pursue love or marriage based solely on phone interactions.** It\'s often an illusion; the real world is entirely different.\\n> - **Your mother is paramount.** She carried you for nine months, enduring so much, and then showed you the world. Cherish her.\\n> - He also taught me a lot about **Karma**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Tech Wisdom from a Nonagenarian\\n\\nPerhaps the most fascinating encounter was with an 85-year-old man who knew an incredible amount about computers \u2013 almost as much as a computer science student! He shared insights into computer evolution and even knew **QBASIC**, a language that\'s practically ancient now. He explained different types of printers and emphasized that to truly understand technology, \\"you have to know everything about everything. You should know instructions and all.\\"\\n\\nHe also gave me valuable advice on how to approach answers, especially in exams. He stressed the importance of incorporating **modern trends** to show the examiner you\'re well-read. For example, if you\'re writing about computer viruses, you should include examples of current virus names. He also touched upon versioning, explaining how different versions of software like Word or Excel (e.g., 2016) can complicate things. He gave a relatable example: we were taught what PowerPoint is and how it works, but we were rarely shown any practical demonstrations.\\n\\nThis led to his core message: **\\"Practical is the way. Just focus on practical rather than theory.\\"** I completely agree with him on this. Thank you, Buwa, for these invaluable lessons."},{"id":"breaking-down-the-problem","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/breaking-down-the-problem","source":"@site/blog/2025-04-27-php-project.md","title":"From Chaos to Clarity","description":"A raw, honest dive into building a PHP portal from scratch, grappling with a new tech stack, and learning to embrace the mess of coding.","date":"2025-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Technical","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/technical","description":"You can find all technical related blogs here."},{"inline":false,"label":"Development","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/development","description":"Software development practices and experiences."}],"readingTime":2.215,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Abishek Neupane","title":"Self Learner","url":"https://github.com/virtualabishek","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/virtualabishek"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/virtualabishek","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/virtualabishek/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/virtualabishek"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/virtualabishek.png","key":"virtualabishek"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"breaking-down-the-problem","title":"From Chaos to Clarity","authors":["virtualabishek"],"date":"2025-04-27","description":"A raw, honest dive into building a PHP portal from scratch, grappling with a new tech stack, and learning to embrace the mess of coding.","tags":["technical","development"],"hide_table_of_contents":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Tech Wisdom and Village realitie","permalink":"/blog/tech-wisdom-from-a-85-year-old-buwa"},"nextItem":{"title":"Everyday Reflections: Life\'s Unexpected Moments","permalink":"/blog/everyday-reflections"}},"content":"Lately, I\u2019ve been working on a project I never thought would see the light of day. The tech stack was completely different from anything I\u2019d tackled before. I built a portal using PHP, with the entire UI crafted in HTML. Coming from a Node.js background, I was out of my comfort zone, unsure of what to do and what to avoid. I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t be that developer who sticks to just one tech stack\u2014especially in today\u2019s world, where AI makes it possible for anyone to create almost anything. Still, the process wasn\u2019t easy. I wrestled with a ton of PHP libraries\u2014installing, importing, and figuring out how to use them.\\n\\nFor the PHP backend, I went old-school. I handled routing with a switch statement, manually creating all the routes and APIs from scratch. Where I really struggled was the file structure. In my Node.js projects, I prided myself on clean, organized files. But with this project? Total chaos. Making the UI dynamic added another layer of confusion. I was second-guessing every decision, unsure of what would work.\\n\\nI finished the project about a month ago, and to my surprise, I recently spoke with the stakeholders, and they want to deploy it. I was shocked. I know the portal works, but I\u2019m not fully confident in the UI or some other parts. If I\u2019d used React with something like Shadcn, I\u2019d feel much better about it. But they saw the demo, liked it, and are ready to move forward. I was floored\u2014part of me was like, \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d What if I need to add more features? What if it\u2019s deployed and I can\u2019t make changes easily? What if the project grows and becomes too complex?\\n\\nAfter some back-and-forth, I convinced them that this is the version for now, and they agreed. Once my board exams are over, I plan to revisit and improve it.\\n\\n## What I\u2019ve Learned\\n\\nLooking back, I realize I just needed to rant a bit. But here\u2019s the bigger picture: coding, at its core, is about breaking problems into smaller, manageable steps. With AI and modern tools, that\u2019s more true than ever. If you can take one big problem and split it into ten smaller ones\u2014and truly understand what your code is doing\u2014you can build anything. The tools or tech stack? They\u2019re secondary. What matters is understanding the ecosystem and how it all fits together.\\n\\nI\u2019ve been crazy busy lately, juggling board exam prep and multiple projects, but I\u2019m enjoying the process. It\u2019s messy, it\u2019s challenging, but it\u2019s also rewarding. I\u2019ll probably write another update after my exams. For now, this is just me reflecting on the journey."},{"id":"everyday-reflections","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/everyday-reflections","source":"@site/blog/2025-04-08-nepal.md","title":"Everyday Reflections: Life\'s Unexpected Moments","description":"Personal reflections on everyday struggles in Nepal from the lens of a non-political observer.","date":"2025-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"betryed","permalink":"/blog/tags/betryed"},{"inline":false,"label":"Non Technical","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/non-technical","description":"You can find all non-technical related blogs here."}],"readingTime":2.645,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Abishek Neupane","title":"Self Learner","url":"https://github.com/virtualabishek","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/virtualabishek"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/virtualabishek","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/virtualabishek/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/virtualabishek"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/virtualabishek.png","key":"virtualabishek"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"everyday-reflections","title":"Everyday Reflections: Life\'s Unexpected Moments","authors":["virtualabishek"],"date":"2025-04-08","description":"Personal reflections on everyday struggles in Nepal from the lens of a non-political observer.","tags":["betryed","non-technical"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"From Chaos to Clarity","permalink":"/blog/breaking-down-the-problem"},"nextItem":{"title":"My Linux Journey and the Power of WSL","permalink":"/blog/linux-and-wsl-journeys"}},"content":"Hey everyone, I just want to share some random thoughts today. Here in Nepal, people who aren\u2019t interested in politicians, parties, or all that drama seem to suffer the most. I\u2019ve had so many experiences\u2014some made me feel terrible, others were good. Everything that\u2019s happened to me, I always thought it\u2019d leave a positive mark, teaching me lessons along the way.\\n\\nThere\u2019s a lot swirling in my head right now. Honestly, people who went abroad right after +2 wouldn\u2019t get what I\u2019m talking about. I think those who left after their bachelor\u2019s might understand more\u2014they\u2019ve probably seen more than I have.\\n\\nI see quarrels everywhere here. Me, I\u2019ve never been the type to fight or argue. Even when I\u2019m not wrong, I end up saying sorry just to keep the peace. Sometimes, being too polite or asking simple questions makes you feel bad. Take today, for example\u2014I was in Kathmandu for WordCamp 2025. I stopped at a local cafe and ordered a cup of tea. I didn\u2019t have small change, so I handed the guy a 500-rupee note. He said he didn\u2019t have change, which was fine\u2014I get it, maybe I was the first customer of the day. So I asked if there was a QR code to pay digitally. He said no, and I was shocked. I went to a nearby shop, bought something I didn\u2019t even need just to break the 500, and came back to pay. Then he goes, \u201cWhy should I get a QR code for this? If it was something like rice or a big meal, I\u2019d understand.\u201d Bro, who comes to your shop at 6 a.m. to eat a heavy meal? So yeah, that\u2019s just one little thing from today.\\n\\nI\u2019ve been through a lot and forgotten even more. Public transport here? Don\u2019t get me started. I\u2019ve had so many bad experiences. Whenever I travel to Kathmandu, back to Chitwan, or anywhere else, it\u2019s always a mess. I ask for a specific seat when I buy my ticket, and they tell me it\u2019s full, shoving me to the back. Later, I find out it wasn\u2019t full\u2014they just wanted to pack the back seats first. The fares? I\u2019ve been cheated so many times. They charge whatever they feel like. Once, they owed me 300 rupees in change\u2014it was even written on the ticket\u2014but they argued with me and refused to pay. During festivals, not even on the main day of Dashain, but toward the end, they double the fare. Where do I complain? How do I fix this? I just end up letting it go.\\n\\nAnd education? It\u2019s a disaster. I study at Tribhuvan University (TU), Institute of Science and Technology. I\u2019ve switched between two government colleges. I\u2019m not into politics or parties\u2014you probably know how things work there if you\u2019re not involved. The education system is a total waste, at least from my perspective. TU and its government colleges feel like a cheap certificate factory. You\u2019re on your own\u2014your browser tabs are your real teachers. I\u2019m not blaming the teachers; it\u2019s the system. Getting anything done takes forever\u2014long processes for even the smallest service.\\n\\nI\u2019m exhausted, honestly.

I\u2019m not experienced one but someone who\u2019s explored operating systems with curiosity and a bit of trial-and-error. \x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\nIn this post, I\u2019ll walk you through my Linux journey, from my early experiments to finding Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It\u2019s been quite a ride, and I hope sharing it sparks something for you.\\n\\n## My Story with Linux and WSL\\n\\nFor anyone new to the term, **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** is a feature that lets you run a Linux environment right on your Windows machine. No need for a separate virtual machine or dual-boot setup\u2014it\u2019s a seamless way to blend the best of both worlds, especially for developers.\\n\\nMy Linux adventure kicked off years ago, thanks to my brother **Acyut Dai**, who first showed me the ropes. I was hooked right away, even if I didn\u2019t fully grasp the technical side back then. One memory stands out: I went to a shop to buy a laptop and asked for **Linux Mint** instead of Windows. The salesperson was caught off guard\u2014probably not a request he got every day. That was my launchpad into the Linux world.\\n\\nWith **Linux Mint** on my laptop, I dove in, exploring its features for hours. Truth be told, I didn\u2019t have a strong grip on the basics. Over time, I bounced between **12 to 15 different Linux distributions**, chasing the next shiny thing without really mastering any of them. Looking back, I was more caught up in the excitement than in laying a solid groundwork.\\n\\nFast forward a bit, and I got access to Windows developer features, which led me to **WSL**. It was a total game-changer. Suddenly, I felt more productive, blending Linux tools into my Windows routine effortlessly. I think Windows saw how much developers were leaning toward Linux and built WSL to meet that need. It\u2019s pretty powerful\u2014think installing packages with a quick `sudo apt install` instead of wrestling with Windows-specific headaches.\\n\\nI\u2019ve never fully clicked with Windows\u2019 own command-line tools, though that\u2019s probably on me for not digging deeper. Windows is great for tons of people; WSL just smooths out certain tasks for me.\\n\\nWSL has made a huge impact for developers globally, though it\u2019s not a must-have for everyone\u2014it\u2019s all about what works for you. As a newbie blogger, I\u2019m just here to share my take. **Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve loved about WSL:**\\n\\n- **Command-Line Power**: It rekindled my appreciation for the command line\u2014super efficient and flexible.\\n- **Easy Setup**: Installing languages and packages is a breeze, cutting down on setup time.\\n- **Storage Smarts**: From what I\u2019ve seen, WSL handles storage for code and modules pretty efficiently compared to a full Linux setup (though your mileage might vary).\\n\\nThere\u2019s tons more to dig into, and I\u2019d love to hear what you think about WSL if you\u2019ve tried it!\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nLooking back, WSL has become a key part of my development toolkit. It ties Windows and Linux together, letting me tap into both without the chaos of my distro-hopping phase. My Linux days taught me to **stay focused while learning**, and WSL keeps me grounded.\\n\\nIf you haven\u2019t checked it out yet, **give it a whirl!** Already a user? I\u2019d love your thoughts.

It went like this:\\n\\n> \\"These days, the internet is full of inspirational sayings, movies, and postings. However, what matters most is how much you use them in your life, regardless of how much you read or watch. Nothing is permanent, not even your beliefs, driving forces, or favorite quotations. Maybe you only remember them when you\'re in a good mood. When you\'re feeling down or unhappy, I\'m sure you lose sight of your motivation.\\"\\n\\nYou can read more of my ramblings here: [abishekn.com.np/perspective](https://abishekn.com.np/perspective).\\n\\nHere\u2019s the thing: all this hustling we do\u2014working hard for a nice house, a fancy car, or to get better at something\u2014it\u2019s really about **presence**. People always say, _\u201cDon\u2019t dwell on the past, it\u2019ll hurt you.\u201d_ Fair enough. But I\u2019d argue looking too far into the future can mess up your **now** just as much. Every second you spend distracted or lost? It\u2019s gone forever. You don\u2019t get it back.\\n\\nSo, what I\u2019m getting at is this: **focus on the moment**. Enjoy the process. I\u2019m convinced that\u2019s where real joy and happiness hide. Think about it\u2014you forget where you left your keys, you miss an important moment because you\u2019re zoned out, or you finally get something you\u2019ve always wanted and feel that rush of pride. But do you remember how hard you worked for it? Probably not. Success has a way of wiping the slate clean. Then, boom, new desires pop up, and the cycle starts again.\\n\\nThat\u2019s life, right? An endless loop of wanting, chasing, and forgetting. We all know this deep down\u2014it\u2019s nothing groundbreaking. But living it? Actually **staying present**? That\u2019s the tricky part.\\n\\nI\u2019ll be real with you\u2014I\u2019m not even sure where I\u2019m going with this. It\u2019s just a stream of thoughts, typed out for fun. Hope you enjoyed it, though! Thanks for reading, and catch you in the next one."},{"id":"first-blog","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/first-blog","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-03-first-blog.md","title":"Hello World","description":"Hello!
