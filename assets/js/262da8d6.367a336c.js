Here in Nepal, people who aren\u2019t interested in politicians, parties, or all that drama seem to suffer the most. I\u2019ve had so many experiences\u2014some made me feel terrible, others were good. Everything that\u2019s happened to me, I always thought it\u2019d leave a positive mark, teaching me lessons along the way."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"There\u2019s a lot swirling in my head right now.

Me, I\u2019ve never been the type to fight or argue. Even when I\u2019m not wrong, I end up saying sorry just to keep the peace. Sometimes, being too polite or asking simple questions makes you feel bad. Take today, for example\u2014I was in Kathmandu for WordCamp 2025. I stopped at a local cafe and ordered a cup of tea. I didn\u2019t have small change, so I handed the guy a 500-rupee note. He said he didn\u2019t have change, which was fine\u2014I get it, maybe I was the first customer of the day. So I asked if there was a QR code to pay digitally. He said no, and I was shocked. I went to a nearby shop, bought something I didn\u2019t even need just to break the 500, and came back to pay. Then he goes, \u201cWhy should I get a QR code for this? If it was something like rice or a big meal, I\u2019d understand.\u201d Bro, who comes to your shop at 6 a.m. to eat a heavy meal? So yeah, that\u2019s just one little thing from today."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I\u2019ve been through a lot and forgotten even more. Public transport here? Don\u2019t get me started. I\u2019ve had so many bad experiences. Whenever I travel to Kathmandu, back to Chitwan, or anywhere else, it\u2019s always a mess. I ask for a specific seat when I buy my ticket, and they tell me it\u2019s full, shoving me to the back. Later, I find out it wasn\u2019t full\u2014they just wanted to pack the back seats first. The fares? I\u2019ve been cheated so many times. They charge whatever they feel like. Once, they owed me 300 rupees in change\u2014it was even written on the ticket\u2014but they argued with me and refused to pay. During festivals, not even on the main day of Dashain, but toward the end, they double the fare. Where do I complain? How do I fix this? I just end up letting it go."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And education? It\u2019s a disaster. I study at Tribhuvan University (TU), Institute of Science and Technology. I\u2019ve switched between two government colleges. I\u2019m not into politics or parties\u2014you probably know how things work there if you\u2019re not involved. The education system is a total waste, at least from my perspective. TU and its government colleges feel like a cheap certificate factory. You\u2019re on your own\u2014your browser tabs are your real teachers. I\u2019m not blaming the teachers; it\u2019s the system.
