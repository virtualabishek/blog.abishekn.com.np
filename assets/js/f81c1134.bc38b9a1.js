Here in Nepal, people who aren\u2019t interested in politicians, parties, or all that drama seem to suffer the most. I\u2019ve had so many experiences\u2014some made me feel terrible, others were good. Everything that\u2019s happened to me, I always thought it\u2019d leave a positive mark, teaching me lessons along the way.\\n\\nThere\u2019s a lot swirling in my head right now. Honestly, people who went abroad right after +2 wouldn\u2019t get what I\u2019m talking about. I think those who left after their bachelor\u2019s might understand more\u2014they\u2019ve probably seen more than I have.\\n\\nI see quarrels everywhere here. Me, I\u2019ve never been the type to fight or argue. Even when I\u2019m not wrong, I end up saying sorry just to keep the peace. Sometimes, being too polite or asking simple questions makes you feel bad. Take today, for example\u2014I was in Kathmandu for WordCamp 2025. I stopped at a local caf\xe9 and ordered a cup of tea. I didn\u2019t have small change, so I handed the guy a 500-rupee note. He said he didn\u2019t have change, which was fine\u2014I get it, maybe I was the first customer of the day. So I asked if there was a QR code to pay digitally. He said no, and I was shocked. I went to a nearby shop, bought something I didn\u2019t even need just to break the 500, and came back to pay. Then he goes, \u201cWhy should I get a QR code for this? If it was something like rice or a big meal, I\u2019d understand.\u201d Bro, who comes to your shop at 6 a.m. to eat a heavy meal? So yeah, that\u2019s just one little thing from today.\\n\\nI\u2019ve been through a lot and forgotten even more. Public transport here? Don\u2019t get me started. I\u2019ve had so many bad experiences. Whenever I travel to Kathmandu, back to Chitwan, or anywhere else, it\u2019s always a mess. I ask for a specific seat when I buy my ticket, and they tell me it\u2019s full, shoving me to the back. Later, I find out it wasn\u2019t full\u2014they just wanted to pack the back seats first. The fares? I\u2019ve been cheated so many times. They charge whatever they feel like. Once, they owed me 300 rupees in change\u2014it was even written on the ticket\u2014but they argued with me and refused to pay. During festivals, not even on the main day of Dashain, but toward the end, they double the fare. Where do I complain? How do I fix this? I just end up letting it go.\\n\\nAnd education? It\u2019s a disaster. I study at Tribhuvan University (TU), Institute of Science and Technology. I\u2019ve switched between two government colleges. I\u2019m not into politics or parties\u2014you probably know how things work there if you\u2019re not involved. The education system is a total waste, at least from my perspective. TU and its government colleges feel like a cheap certificate factory. You\u2019re on your own\u2014your browser tabs are your real teachers. I\u2019m not blaming the teachers; it\u2019s the system. Getting anything done takes forever\u2014long processes for even the smallest service.\\n\\nI\u2019m exhausted, honestly. Still, I\u2019m hoping for the best."},{"id":"linux-and-wsl-journeys","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/linux-and-wsl-journeys","source":"@site/blog/2025-04-04-Why-WSL.md","title":"My Linux Journey and the Power of WSL","description":"Exploring Linux, distro-hopping, and how WSL changed my development workflow.","date":"2025-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Technical","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/technical","description":"You can find all technical related blogs here."},{"inline":false,"label":"Linux","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/linux","description":"Linux-related posts and tutorials."},{"inline":false,"label":"WSL","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/wsl","description":"Posts about Windows Subsystem for Linux."},{"inline":false,"label":"Windows","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/windows","description":"Windows-related content and tips."},{"inline":false,"label":"Development","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/development","description":"Software development practices and experiences."}],"readingTime":2.825,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Abishek Neupane","title":"Self Learner","url":"https://github.com/virtualabishek","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/virtualabishek"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/virtualabishek","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/virtualabishek/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/virtualabishek"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/virtualabishek.png","key":"virtualabishek"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"linux-and-wsl-journeys","title":"My Linux Journey and the Power of WSL","authors":["virtualabishek"],"date":"2025-04-02","description":"Exploring Linux, distro-hopping, and how WSL changed my development workflow.","tags":["technical","linux","wsl","windows","development"],"hide_table_of_contents":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Random Thoughts from Nepal","permalink":"/blog/random-thoughts-from-nepal"},"nextItem":{"title":"Too Much Philosophy, Not Enough Presence","permalink":"/blog/too-much-philosophy"}},"content":"## Introduction\\n\\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered about dipping your toes into Linux without leaving the comfort of Windows, you\u2019re in good company. I\u2019m not experienced one but someone who\u2019s explored operating systems with curiosity and a bit of trial-and-error. \x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\nIn this post, I\u2019ll walk you through my Linux journey, from my early experiments to finding Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It\u2019s been quite a ride, and I hope sharing it sparks something for you.\\n\\n## My Story with Linux and WSL\\n\\nFor anyone new to the term, **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** is a feature that lets you run a Linux environment right on your Windows machine. No need for a separate virtual machine or dual-boot setup\u2014it\u2019s a seamless way to blend the best of both worlds, especially for developers.\\n\\nMy Linux adventure kicked off years ago, thanks to my brother **Acyut Dai**, who first showed me the ropes. I was hooked right away, even if I didn\u2019t fully grasp the technical side back then. One memory stands out: I went to a shop to buy a laptop and asked for **Linux Mint** instead of Windows. The salesperson was caught off guard\u2014probably not a request he got every day. That was my launchpad into the Linux world.\\n\\nWith **Linux Mint** on my laptop, I dove in, exploring its features for hours. Truth be told, I didn\u2019t have a strong grip on the basics. Over time, I bounced between **12 to 15 different Linux distributions**, chasing the next shiny thing without really mastering any of them. Looking back, I was more caught up in the excitement than in laying a solid groundwork.\\n\\nFast forward a bit, and I got access to Windows developer features, which led me to **WSL**. It was a total game-changer. Suddenly, I felt more productive, blending Linux tools into my Windows routine effortlessly. I think Windows saw how much developers were leaning toward Linux and built WSL to meet that need. It\u2019s pretty powerful\u2014think installing packages with a quick `sudo apt install` instead of wrestling with Windows-specific headaches.\\n\\nI\u2019ve never fully clicked with Windows\u2019 own command-line tools, though that\u2019s probably on me for not digging deeper. Windows is great for tons of people; WSL just smooths out certain tasks for me.\\n\\nWSL has made a huge impact for developers globally, though it\u2019s not a must-have for everyone\u2014it\u2019s all about what works for you. As a newbie blogger, I\u2019m just here to share my take. **Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve loved about WSL:**\\n\\n- **Command-Line Power**: It rekindled my appreciation for the command line\u2014super efficient and flexible.\\n- **Easy Setup**: Installing languages and packages is a breeze, cutting down on setup time.\\n- **Storage Smarts**: From what I\u2019ve seen, WSL handles storage for code and modules pretty efficiently compared to a full Linux setup (though your mileage might vary).\\n\\nThere\u2019s tons more to dig into, and I\u2019d love to hear what you think about WSL if you\u2019ve tried it!\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nLooking back, WSL has become a key part of my development toolkit. It ties Windows and Linux together, letting me tap into both without the chaos of my distro-hopping phase. My Linux days taught me to **stay focused while learning**, and WSL keeps me grounded.\\n\\nIf you haven\u2019t checked it out yet, **give it a whirl!** Already a user? I\u2019d love your thoughts. Thanks for reading my first post\u2014more to come!"},{"id":"too-much-philosophy","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/too-much-philosophy","source":"@site/blog/2025-04-2-First-Blog-Post.md","title":"Too Much Philosophy, Not Enough Presence","description":"A reflection on the balance between thinking and truly living.","date":"2025-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Philosophy","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/philosophy","description":"You can find all Philosophy related blogs here."},{"inline":false,"label":"Non Technical","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/non-technical","description":"You can find all non-technical related blogs here."}],"readingTime":2.01,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Abishek Neupane","title":"Self Learner","url":"https://github.com/virtualabishek","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/virtualabishek"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/virtualabishek","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/virtualabishek/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/virtualabishek"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/virtualabishek.png","key":"virtualabishek"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"too-much-philosophy","title":"Too Much Philosophy, Not Enough Presence","authors":["virtualabishek"],"date":"2025-04-02","description":"A reflection on the balance between thinking and truly living.","tags":["philosophy","non-technical"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"My Linux Journey and the Power of WSL","permalink":"/blog/linux-and-wsl-journeys"},"nextItem":{"title":"Hello World","permalink":"/blog/first-blog"}},"content":"Recently, I stumbled across a post on X that really hit me.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<blockquote className=\\"twitter-tweet\\">\\n  <p lang=\\"zxx\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">\\n    <a href=\\"https://t.co/28bsnyYSZK\\">pic.twitter.com/28bsnyYSZK</a>\\n  </p>\\n  \u2014 \u2605 (@thematrixwizard){\\" \\"}\\n  <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/thematrixwizard/status/1898988630967800312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\\">\\n    March 10, 2025\\n  </a>\\n</blockquote>\\n<script async src=\\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\\" charSet=\\"utf-8\\"><\/script>\\n\\nThe caption was simple: **\\"Too much philosophy, not enough presence.\\"** And honestly, it felt so true. We spend so much of our lives chasing positivity\u2014trying to do good, be good, and hope only the best comes our way. But life doesn\u2019t always play along, does it?\\n\\nA while back, I wrote something that ties into this. It went like this:\\n\\n> \\"These days, the internet is full of inspirational sayings, movies, and postings. However, what matters most is how much you use them in your life, regardless of how much you read or watch. Nothing is permanent, not even your beliefs, driving forces, or favorite quotations. Maybe you only remember them when you\'re in a good mood. When you\'re feeling down or unhappy, I\'m sure you lose sight of your motivation.\\"\\n\\nYou can read more of my ramblings here: [abishekn.com.np/perspective](https://abishekn.com.np/perspective).\\n\\nHere\u2019s the thing: all this hustling we do\u2014working hard for a nice house, a fancy car, or to get better at something\u2014it\u2019s really about **presence**. People always say, _\u201cDon\u2019t dwell on the past, it\u2019ll hurt you.\u201d_ Fair enough. But I\u2019d argue looking too far into the future can mess up your **now** just as much. Every second you spend distracted or lost? It\u2019s gone forever. You don\u2019t get it back.\\n\\nSo, what I\u2019m getting at is this: **focus on the moment**. Enjoy the process. I\u2019m convinced that\u2019s where real joy and happiness hide. Think about it\u2014you forget where you left your keys, you miss an important moment because you\u2019re zoned out, or you finally get something you\u2019ve always wanted and feel that rush of pride. But do you remember how hard you worked for it? Probably not. Success has a way of wiping the slate clean. Then, boom, new desires pop up, and the cycle starts again.\\n\\nThat\u2019s life, right? An endless loop of wanting, chasing, and forgetting. We all know this deep down\u2014it\u2019s nothing groundbreaking. But living it? Actually **staying present**? That\u2019s the tricky part.\\n\\nI\u2019ll be real with you\u2014I\u2019m not even sure where I\u2019m going with this. It\u2019s just a stream of thoughts, typed out for fun. Hope you enjoyed it, though!
