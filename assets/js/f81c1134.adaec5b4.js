We spend so much of our lives chasing positivity\u2014trying to do good, be good, and hope only the best comes our way. But life doesn\u2019t always play along, does it?\\n\\nA while back, I wrote something that ties into this. It went like this:\\n\\n> \\"These days, the internet is overflowing with inspirational quotes, movies, and posts. But what really matters is how much you actually live them, not just how much you scroll through or watch. Nothing lasts forever\u2014not your beliefs, your motivations, or even your favorite sayings. Maybe they stick with you when you\u2019re feeling on top of the world. But when you\u2019re down, lost, or upset, I bet you forget all about that spark.\\"\\n\\nYou can read more of my ramblings here: [abishekn.com.np/perspective](https://abishekn.com.np/perspective).\\n\\nHere\u2019s the thing: all this hustling we do\u2014working hard for a nice house, a fancy car, or to get better at something\u2014it\u2019s really about **presence**. People always say, _\u201cDon\u2019t dwell on the past, it\u2019ll hurt you.\u201d_ Fair enough. But I\u2019d argue looking too far into the future can mess up your **now** just as much. Every second you spend distracted or lost? It\u2019s gone forever. You don\u2019t get it back.\\n\\nSo, what I\u2019m getting at is this: **focus on the moment**. Enjoy the process. I\u2019m convinced that\u2019s where real joy and happiness hide. Think about it\u2014you forget where you left your keys, you miss an important moment because you\u2019re zoned out, or you finally get something you\u2019ve always wanted and feel that rush of pride. But do you remember how hard you worked for it? Probably not. Success has a way of wiping the slate clean. Then, boom, new desires pop up, and the cycle starts again.\\n\\nThat\u2019s life, right? An endless loop of wanting, chasing, and forgetting. We all know this deep down\u2014it\u2019s nothing groundbreaking. But living it? Actually **staying present**? That\u2019s the tricky part.\\n\\nI\u2019ll be real with you\u2014I\u2019m not even sure where I\u2019m going with this. It\u2019s just a stream of thoughts, typed out for fun. Hope you enjoyed it, though! Thanks for reading, and catch you in the next one."},{"id":"first-blog","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/first-blog","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-03-first-blog.md","title":"Hello World","description":"Hello!
